READY TO DEPLOYMENT CODE:

1. binance_gws.py
Test availability of binance api gateways.
It could be useful if api gateway /api/ on binance dies and we need to fix it fastly.
To fix it fastly you can change /api/ gateway on other (/api1/ ...etc...)

2. endpoint_requests.py
Test connection to usual user (NOT CORPORATIVE) account.
Feel free to use my credentials on the prod, but if you need to login on account you have to ask me.
It could be useful to know if there is possible problems on the Binance side with API

3. time_difference.py
Test time sync with PC and Binance servers.
If there is time difference between Binance and our environment more than 5000 ms then there would be
some problems with signing our requests. If that test fails you need to check that environment time
synced with internet
